## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A Vercel KV database instance
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ask-pg.git
cd ask-pg
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
KV_URL=your_vercel_kv_url_here
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=your_kv_readonly_token_here
KV_REST_API_URL=your_kv_rest_api_url_here
```

4. Set up the vector store by going to [OpenAI's vector store page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and creating a new vector store, and uploading the essays in /public/essays. Then, get the vector store ID and update the `vectorStoreId` in `config/ai.ts`.

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to start chatting!

## üîß Configuration

### AI Configuration (`config/ai.ts`)

The `config/ai.ts` file contains important settings for the AI chat functionality:

- `model`: Specifies the OpenAI model to use (default: "gpt-4o-mini")
- `defaultSystemPrompt`: The system prompt that defines PG's personality and behavior
- `fileSearch`: Configuration for the vector store search
  - `vectorStoreId`: ID for the vector store containing PG's essays
  - `maxResults`: Maximum number of essay results to return per search
- `storeResponse`: Whether to store generated responses for later retrieval

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing the GPT models
- `KV_URL`: Vercel KV database URL for storing chat data
- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`: Read-only token for KV REST API access
- `KV_REST_API_URL`: URL for the KV REST API endpoint

### Vector Store Setup

Before the application can function properly, you'll need to:

1. Upload Paul Graham's essays to OpenAI's vector storage
2. Get your vector store ID from OpenAI
3. Update the `vectorStoreId` in `config/ai.ts` with your vector store ID

Without this setup, the semantic search functionality that helps the AI reference PG's essays will not work.
